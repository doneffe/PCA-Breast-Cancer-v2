	abstract = {The steady-state basal plasma glucose and insulin concentrations are determined by their interaction in a feedback loop. A computer-solved model has been used to predict the homeostatic concentrations which arise from varying degrees of beta-cell deficiency and insulin resistance. Comparison of a patient's fasting values with the model's predictions allows a quantitative assessment of the contributions of insulin resistance and deficient beta-cell function to the fasting hyperglycaemia (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA). The accuracy and precision of the estimate have been determined by comparison with independent measures of insulin resistance and beta-cell function using hyperglycaemic and euglycaemic clamps and an intravenous glucose tolerance test. The estimate of insulin resistance obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with estimates obtained by use of the euglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.88, p {\textless} 0.0001), the fasting insulin concentration (Rs = 0.81, p {\textless} 0.0001), and the hyperglycaemic clamp, (Rs = 0.69, p {\textless} 0.01). There was no correlation with any aspect of insulin-receptor binding. The estimate of deficient beta-cell function obtained by homeostasis model assessment correlated with that derived using the hyperglycaemic clamp (Rs = 0.61, p {\textless} 0.01) and with the estimate from the intravenous glucose tolerance test (Rs = 0.64, p {\textless} 0.05). The low precision of the estimates from the model (coefficients of variation: 31\% for insulin resistance and 32\% for beta-cell deficit) limits its use, but the correlation of the model's estimates with patient data accords with the hypothesis that basal glucose and insulin interactions are largely determined by a simple feed back loop.},

It is now clear that obesity is associated with a state of chronic low-level inflammation. In this article, we discuss the molecular and cellular underpinnings of obesity-induced inflammation and the signaling pathways at the intersection of metabolism and inflammation that contribute to diabetes. We also consider mechanisms through which the inflammatory response may be initiated and discuss the reasons for the inflammatory response in obesity. We put forth for consideration some hypotheses regarding important unanswered questions in the field and suggest a model for the integration of inflammatory and metabolic pathways in metabolic disease.},

	abstract = {Collagen-induced arthritis was produced in rats by intradermal immunization with type II collagen and the expression and production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) were examined by immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Northern blot analysis. Two to three weeks after the immunization, the hindfeet showed swelling and redness, followed by the development of severe arthritis, particularly in the ankle joints. During this period, prominent infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages was observed. Sandwich ELISA and Northern blot analysis revealed that MCP-1 concentrations in the joint lavages and MCP-1 mRNA levels in the joint tissues both peaked at 2 weeks after the immunization. By immunohistochemistry, various types of cells, particularly neutrophils, macrophages, synovial cells, and vascular endothelial cells, stained positively for MCP-1. Finally, injection of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody against rat MCP-1 significantly decreased the number of exudate macrophages in the lesions and reduced the ankle swelling by about 30 per cent compared with controls. These results suggest that MCP-1 plays a critical role in this model in the recruitment of monocytes and in the development of arthritis. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review
Quetelet reported in the nineteenth century that body weight varies across adults with the square of height. Quetelet's index, now known as BMI, is accepted by most health organizations as a first-level measure of body fat and as a screening tool for diagnosing
excess adiposity. Modern imaging methods now, however, indicate that BMI has limited predictive value for estimating body fat and lean mass at the individual level. The use of BMI as a measure of body composition in the clinical setting should therefore be challenged.
Recent findings
Recent
studies enrolling cancer and surgical patients reported discrepant outcomes when BMI was used as a body composition surrogate. Sarcopenia, loss of muscle mass and function, which affects the elderly and those with chronic and acute diseases, is not accurately diagnosed with BMI. The distribution
of adipose tissue is not characterized by BMI, specific measures of which have greater predictive value for metabolic impairments and clinical outcomes.Summary
BMI, as the traditional tool for assessing malnutrition and obesity, is not appropriate
to accurately differentiate between important body weight components and therefore should not be used for making clinically important decisions at the individual patient level.},

As both a monomer and as part of more complex structures such as polysaccharides and glucosides, glucose also plays a major role in modern food products, particularly where flavor and or structure are concerned. Over the years, many diverse methods for detecting and quantifying glucose have been developed; this review presents an overview of the most widely employed and historically significant, including copper iodometry, HPLC, GC, CZE, and enzyme based systems such as glucose meters. The relative strengths and limitations of each method are evaluated, and examples of their recent application in the realm of food chemistry are discussed.},
